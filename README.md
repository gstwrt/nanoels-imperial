# NanoEls

This is a modified version of nanoELS with support for inch measurements and tpi pitch.  Only H2 has been modified.  Tests are not yet implemented.

Cheap DIY Electronic Lead Screw (ELS) based on Arduino Nano for metal lathes.

There are 2 hardware versions of NanoEls, [H1](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/blob/main/h1/) is older, [H2 is newer](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/blob/main/h2/) and more capable.

# Contributing to the project

- Questions: please open a new GitHub Discussion
- Successful/failed builds: please file a GitHub Issue with explanations and photos
- Code changes: to maximize the chance of your PR being accepted, [discuss the planned change](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels/discussions/new) beforehand
  - Only make the necessary minimal edits
  - Run in the `TEST` mode, add new tests if needed
  - Split unrelated changes into separate PRs
- PCB changes: please open a new GitHub Discussion
- 3D models: in most cases, don't edit the model, add a new file. PNG preview and a dimension would be nice too.

# Looking for resellers and manufacturers

If you're willing to manufacture this device and/or sell it as a kit, we'd be happy to link to your page for free - especially if it makes the build cheaper than buying all the components separately.
